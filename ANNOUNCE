This is release 950606 of Wine the MS Windows emulator.  This is still a
developer's only release.  There are many bugs and many unimplemented API
features.  Most applications still do not work.

Patches should be submitted to "wine-new@amscons.com".  Please don't forget
to include a ChangeLog entry.  I'll make a new release every other Sunday.

WHAT'S NEW with Wine-950606: (see ChangeLog for details)
	- Lots of module fixes.
	- Better interrupt vectors emulation.
	- Stack no longer limited to 64k when calling X bitmap functions.
	- Lots of bug fixes.

See the README file in the distribution for installation instructions.
