This is release 20050310 of Wine, a free implementation of Windows on
Unix.  This is still a developers only release.  There are many bugs
and unimplemented features.  Most applications still do not work
correctly.

        - Initial implementation of a true Richedit control.
        - Shell extension for browsing Unix directories.
        - More MSI work.
        - PBuffer support in OpenGL.
        - Window painting regressions should be fixed.
        - Lots of bug fixes.
