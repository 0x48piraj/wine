This is release 950202 of Wine the MS Windows emulator.  This is still a
developer's only release.  There are many bugs and many unimplemented API
features.  Most applications still do not work.

Patches should be submitted to "wine-new@amscons.com".  Please don't forget
to include a ChangeLog entry.  I'll make a new release every other Sunday.

WHAT'S NEW with Wine-950202: (see ChangeLog for details)
	- Maximized windows
	- Edit control now uses \r\n for line endings
	- Better registry functions
	- Lots of bug fixes

See the README file in the distribution for installation instructions.
