features.  Most applications still do not work correctly.

forget to include a ChangeLog entry.

	- Better support for non-US keyboards.
	- Support for VFAT filesystem short names.
	- Many improvements to the built-in debugger.
	- More Win32 stuff.
	- Lots of bug fixes.

See the README file in the distribution for installation instructions.
