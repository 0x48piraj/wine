DDE support for Wine
====================

Wine emulator is able to run MS-Windows 3.1 applications under Linux
(Linux is a UNIX clone) . Wine is also a toolkit allowing MS-Windows
applications to compile under Linux. Wine is a world-wide Internet
project with more than 20 developers. Wine is still under development
so many vital MS-Windows features are still missing.

DDE is Dynamic Data Exchange used for communication between MS-Windows
applications. This project adds DDE capabilities into Wine. The new
improved Wine will be able to send messages and share memory between
two different Wine processes.

This project uses System-V IPC mechanisms to implement DDE.

Besides sharing memory handles and sending DDE messages, Wine processes 
are synchronize to emulates MS-Windows non-preemptive task switching.
(MS-Windows switches tasks only on given instructions). This is done
without hurting the performance or stability of a single Wine process.

The project adds DDE to Wine emulator and to the toolkit. This allows
old MS-Windows applications to be compiled for UNIX, and have DDE
working among them.
