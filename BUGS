1. Messaging:

- Message flow is not correct for multiple tasks
- Dialog Boxes created by WM_CREATE handler aren't visible
- MDI does not send WM_GETMINMAX message.
- resizing of MDI child windows sometimes leaves them unrepainted

2. Controls:

- Some features are missing (like VK_SHIFT aided multiple selection in listboxes)

3. Miscellaneous:

- AllocCSToDSAlias() shouldn't alloc alias for the same segment multiple times.

4. Where to look in source files:

- grep for FIXME in the source files.
