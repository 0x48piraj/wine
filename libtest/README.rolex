Windows clock application for WINE (by Jim Peterson)

This is a translation of a Turbo Pascal OWL application I made once,
so it's a little flaky (tons of globals, functions that could have
been in-lined, etc.).  The file rolex.exe is a Win32 application
compiled using this source code and Borland C++ 4.0.

To try it out, type 'make rolex' or 'wine ./rolex.exe' (which fails).
