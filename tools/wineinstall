# Mar 31 1999 - Ove Kåven
#  First version
# Dec 9 1999 - Ove Kåven
#  require Xpm
# Feb 25 2000 - Ove Kåven
#  auto-add /usr/local/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf
# Mar 2 2000 - Ove Kåven
#  source rather than grep config.cache
#  use sourced config.cache to start ldconfig
#  reconfigure if config.cache doesn't exist
# Mar 30 2000 - Ove Kåven
#  autoconfigure no-windows installs
#  do not install registry on real-windows installs
#  some support for binary package installs
#  set and tell user about LD_LIBRARY_PATH if necessary
#  set EXTRA_LD_LIBRARY_PATH in wine.conf
# Apr 9 2000 - Ove Kåven
#  make root's registry global (system-default)
# May 9 2000 - Ove Kåven
#  use ttydrv when running regapi, so we don't have to run from X
#  change debugger path in registry
