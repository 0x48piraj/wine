# History:
# Mar 31 1999 - Ove Kåven
#  First version
# Dec 9 1999 - Ove Kåven
#  require Xpm
# Feb 25 2000 - Ove Kåven
#  auto-add /usr/local/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf
# Mar 2 2000 - Ove Kåven
#  source rather than grep config.cache
#  use sourced config.cache to start ldconfig
#  reconfigure if config.cache doesn't exist
# Mar 30 2000 - Ove Kåven
#  autoconfigure no-windows installs
#  do not install registry on real-windows installs
#  some support for binary package installs
#  set and tell user about LD_LIBRARY_PATH if necessary
#  set EXTRA_LD_LIBRARY_PATH in wine.conf
# Apr 9 2000 - Ove Kåven
#  make root's registry global (system-default)
# May 9 2000 - Ove Kåven
#  use ttydrv when running regapi, so we don't have to run from X
#  change debugger path in registry
# Oct 29 2000 - Ove Kåven
#  added --enable-opengl to default confargs
#  added conf_question, conf_yesno_answer, and conf_string_answer functions
#  added DEFCAT variable
# (later that day...)
#  added conf_reset_question function
#  added file existence checks to the registry copying
#  fixed problem with no-windows directory creation
#  some text reformatting from Eric Maryniak
# Jan 5 2000 - Chris Morgan
#  use default config file in /documentation/samples/config
#  replace .winerc with ~/.wine/config in printed text
#  added user question to convert .winerc file(if exists) or use the default
#    config file
#  add conf_question to allow root to install a local config file and
#    registry
# Jan 12 2000 - Chris Morgan
#  distinguish between creating local and global config files
#  display a message about the status of global config files
#  misc cleanups and reordering of questions
#  added check to see if wine is installed when we are running as a normal
#    user and print a message if wine cannot be found
# Feb 16 2002 - Adam D. Moss
#  Use config.status instead of config.cache to check whether we're
#    configured/compiled and to recreate the configuration
# Feb 20 2002 - Adam D. Moss
#  Partially revert previous changes, force configure to write an
#    old-style config.cache
# Mar 27 2002 - Chris Morgan
#  prevent the user from running wineinstall as root
#  add script commands so we su root for 'make install' and other commands
#    that require root access
#  add text to tell the user we need to run stuff as root so they don't 
#    think we are trying to pull something funny
# Apr 14 2002 - Dustin Navea
#  Fix sed command when finding real-windows registry so it actually 
#   accesses a file (~/.wine/config) instead of null ($CONF?!)
#  Added search for clean-install (not upgrade) Win2k registry
#  (next day, after some sleep)
#  Fix sed string when finding real-windows registry to actually find 
#   windows partition name in [Drive C] section
#  it should now almost always find the windows partition and real-windows 
#  registry (if not, let me know)
