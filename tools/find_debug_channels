# This script scans the whole source code for symbols of the form 
# 'xxx(yyy' where:
#        xxx is either DECLARE_DEBUG_CHANNEL or DEFAULT_DEBUG_CHANNEL
#        yyy is a C identifier 
# It outputs on the standard output a sorted list of the 
# yyy identifiers found in the .c files. 
# Each identifier is reported once. Header files are not scanned.
#
# The script can be given an argument that specifies the files to be
# searched according to the following scheme:
#    - if the argument does not contain a slash (/), the script
#      will search the tree rooted in the current directory for
#      files that match that description. You can also pass
#      wildcard arguments, but remember to quote them to prevent
#      expansion by the shell
#    - if the argument does contain a slash, only that file is
#      searched
#    - if no argument is given, the argument defaults to "*.c"
#      that is, all C files are searched.
#    - if more than one argument is given, only the listed files are
#      searched. Note that in this case, the script will not
#      attempt to find them in some subdirectories, but rather
#      it will try to open them in the current directory.
# Thus, if you want to disable the automatic searching when the file
# name does not contain a /, either prefix the filename with ./
# or add /dev/null as another argument.
