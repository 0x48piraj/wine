Version 1.0.3 (02-Nov-1998)
- Bugfix in write_name_str() [writeres.c] where the length byte/word was
  wrongly counted in the length of the string.
  Thanks to Ulrich Weigand <weigand@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>

Version 1.0.2 (20-Jun-1998)
- Started this file
- Fixed a bug in filename scanning when they are double quoted. The code now
  is compatible with MS' rc and Borland's brc. There is a compromise in the
  filenames because of case-sensitivity under *nix.
- Backslashes in a filepath are now converted to forward slashes and double
- Fixed a bug in printing the filename if loading of a file should fail.
  backslashes are converted to single forward slash.
- Added -L option to prevent conversion to lower case for embedded filenames
  in resource statements.
- Added language posibilities to icons and cursors so that the current
  language is put into the .res ans .s file.
- Added character position indication of an error.
- Fixed CLASS statement so that it accepts double quoted strings as class
  argument. This seems to be the correct behaviour (see SDK). The unquoted
  class-name is still supported because it seems a reasonable option.
- Fixed accelerators with CONTROL option set so that they generate correct
  code instead of generating an error.
- Added testing for flex version 2.5 or better because wrc needs the
  yy_scan* functions to do preprocessing.

Version  1.0.1 (08-Jun-1998)
- Added -A commandline option to generate autoregister code for the winelib
  programs.
