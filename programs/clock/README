 Clock for Wine
 ==============
 
 This is a first attempt to realize a desktop clock for Wine as done in 
 Windows. It'a an early release and most of the code is still broken.

 Please see file TODO for things to do and keep the file ChangeLog
 up to date.

 Code is currently under heavy construction. Nearly all files will 
 change until next release. You can speed up development of clock
 if you send patches and additions directly to my personal email 
 address <mbaur@g26.ethz.ch>.

 I also try to read news:comp.emulators.ms-windows.wine frequently, 
 so I can also integrate patches posted via usenet.
