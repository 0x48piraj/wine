Some ideas for improvements:
============================

- Make "Without Titlebar", Double-clicking the clock should reveal the caption
  again.

- Font Handling of Digital Clock.
  (Does not work probably due to Winelib)

- Complete translation for the following languages : Pt,Sk

- Add new .rc resources for all languages you know. That's in fact very easy. 
  Just clone the file En.rc, change the strings and submit it. You can find
  my email address in the README file.

Please don't forget a ChangeLog entry.
