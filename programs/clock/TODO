Some ideas for improvements:
============================

- Add Font Selection Dialog (should be CommDlg).

- Make "Without Titlebar", Double-clicking the clock should reveal the caption
  again.

- Move the "Without Titlebar" into the System Menu (as in Windows)

- Implement a "digital clock"

- Font Handling of Digital Clock.

- Make distinction between analog clock and digital clock according to
  Globals.bAnalog setting / CL_ANALOG menu event.

- Implement Date (Window caption), but mind the different languages.

- Make distinction between Date / no Date according to
  Globals.bDate setting / CL_DATE menu event.

- Implement Timer Mechanism instead Polling.
  Clock does not run if menu is being selected (?).

- Fix Clock Background (sometimes destroyed).
  ( This is because the old "Hands" are removed one more time )

- Fix English translation by comparing strings from an original English
  Windows Clock application (I only have a German version).

- Add new .rc resources for all languages you know.
