Some ideas for improvements:
============================

- Make "Without Titlebar", Double-clicking the clock should reveal the caption
  again.

- Move the "Without Titlebar" into the System Menu (as in Windows)
  (Does not work probably due to Winelib)

- Font Handling of Digital Clock.
  (Does not work probably due to Winelib)

- Implement Timer Mechanism instead Polling.
  Clock does not run if menu is being selected (?).

- Fix English translation by comparing strings from an original English
  Windows Clock application (I only have a German version).

- Add new .rc resources for all languages you know.
