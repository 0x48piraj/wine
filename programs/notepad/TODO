 - Logfile feature
   if Notepad opens a file with ".LOG" (really?) in the first line, the
   current date/time should automatically be inserted into the last line
   of the file at startup. This feature is not well documented.

 - Notepad segfaults when selecting "Find" button in "Search" dialog.
   This is probably a problem related to Winelib.
 
 - create new *.rc files for all languages you know.
