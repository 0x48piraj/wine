 - Logfile feature
   if Notepad opens a file with ".LOG" (really?) in the first line, the
   current date/time should automatically be inserted into the last line
   of the file at startup. This feature is not well documented.

 - Notepad segfaults when selecting "Find" button in "Search" dialog.
   This is probably a problem related to Winelib.
 
 - There is still something wrong with the 2nd format string of Date/Time.
   With some languages, twice the date is printed (instead of time).
   Other languages, such as french do not support any locales -> annoying.

 - Page Setup dialog box should exchange strings with the corresponding
   Globals.szMargin???-strings (needed to evaluate strings when printing)
   
 - Fields in "Page Setup" dialog box should be initialized.
   
 - create new *.rc files for all languages you know.
