NOTEPAD for WINE
================

This is an early release of notepad and most of the code is still 
broken. It will probably compile but the application will not make
much sense yet.

Please see file TODO for things to do and keep the file ChangeLog
up to date.

Code is currently under heavy construction. Nearly all files will 
change until next release. You can speed up development of notepad
if you send patches and additions directly to my personal email 
address <mbaur@g26.ethz.ch>.

I also try to read news:comp.emulators.ms-windows.wine frequently, 
so I can also integrate patches posted via usenet.
