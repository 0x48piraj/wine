	Running & Compiling WINE in OS/2

Here is what you need to (try to) compile Wine for OS/2:
EMX 0.9c (fix 2)
XFree86 3.2 OS/2 (with development libraries)
bash, gnu make, grep, tar, bison, flex
sed (a working copy of)
diff and patch are recommended

To compile:
sh
tools/make_os2.sh
make depend
make (make doesn't work yet... I will need to do some others patch, or
      you may do it...)

Currently:
- configure and make depend work...
- make doesn't work
- the selectors numbers (0) are wrong...

What needs to be redone:
File functions, I/O access (do it!), Interrupt (if int unknow, call
current RealMode one...), verify that everything is thread safe (how
does Win95/NT handle multi-thread?), move X functions in some files
(and make a wrapper, to use PM instead latter), etc...

The good things:
- OS/2 have DOS interrupts
- OS/2 have I/O port access
- OS/2 have multi-thread
- Merlin have Open32 (to be used later...)
