Win95/Win98 interface code is being introduced.

Instead of compiling Wine for Win3.1 vs. Win95 using #define switches,
the code now looks in a special [Tweak.Layout] section of wine.conf
for a "WineLook=Win95" or "WineLook=Win98" entry.

A few new sections and a number of entries have been added to the
wine.conf file -- these are for debugging the Win95 tweaks only and may
be removed in a future release!  These entries/sections are:

[Tweak.Fonts]
System.Height=<point size>    # Sets the height of the system typeface
System.Bold=[true|false]      # Whether the system font should be boldfaced
System.Italic=[true|false]    # Whether the system font should be italicized
System.Underline=[true|false] # Whether the system font should be underlined
System.StrikeOut=[true|false] # Whether the system font should be struck out
OEMFixed.xxx                  # Same parameters for the OEM fixed typeface
AnsiFixed.xxx                 # Same parameters for the Ansi fixed typeface
AnsiVar.xxx                   # Same parameters for the Ansi variable typeface
SystemFixed.xxx               # Same parameters for the System fixed typeface

[Tweak.Layout]
WineLook=[Win31|Win95|Win98]  # Changes Wine's look and feel
