The dimensions of the controls should be changed so that they will be big 
enough to contain the text for every individual language.

Therefore:

- Dimensions of controls are based on sysres_En.rc.  Other languages should
  change these dimensions in order to make the text fit.

I (krynos@qbc.clic.net) will try to make sysres_Fr.rc fit correctly, if 
someone is interrested in others languages, message me. I may correct 
others languages after, but not soon.

Here are structure of each line (for example):
PUSHBUTTON "&Help", 1038, 174, 75, 50, 14, WS_GROUP | WS_TABSTOP
1038: The ID of this button, you shouldn't change this.
174 : X-offset of the button with respect to the upper-left corner of
      the dialog box.
75  : Y-offset
50  : The width of the button
14  : The height
flags (WS_??? etc): They control how the dialog behaves.  Things like:
                    changing the focus with a TAB, scrolling to a list
                    of radiobuttons with up/down keys, etc.  If you're
                    not sure: leave them as they are (in the english
                    version).

Subject: ChooseColor
         ===========

Today I introduced ChooseColor() to commdlg.c.
Because this old resource was insufficient I wrote a new one
(including some new static contols).

Please delete the old CHOOSECOLOR in YOUR sysres_??.rc   
and insert the new CHOOSECOLOR from sysres_En.rc to YOUR 
language file and translate this as you like it - 
otherwise you'll get an undefined behavour. 

Today it works well for:
* English 
* German
...to be continued......

Thank you.
